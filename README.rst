Docker Loader
*************

**Docker Loader is a Dockerfile alternative with arbitrary restrictions removed
and plenty of features added.**

Quick peek
==========

.. code-block:: python

   from docker_loader import *
   from docker_loader.provisioners import apt

   class Image(ImageDefinition):
       base = 'ubuntu:14.04'
       user = 'redis'
       command = ['/usr/bin/redis-server']
       exposed_ports = [
           (6379, 'tcp')
       ]
       provisioners = [
           apt.AptUpdate(),
           apt.AptInstall(['redis-server']),
       ]

   build(Image).tag('msiedlarek/redis').save('image.tar.gz', compress=True)

Development
===========

You can install package for development and testing with::

   virtualenv environment
   . environment/bin/activate
   pip install tox flake8 wheel
   pip install -e .

To run the test suite on supported Python versions use::

   tox

To only validate PEP8 compliance and run code static checking::

   tox -e flake8

To release::

   git tag -s -u gpgkey@example.com v0.1.0
   python setup.py register
   python setup.py sdist upload -s -i gpgkey@example.com
